# Percentages-and-Fixed-Layout

When do you use percentages and when do you use fixed sizes?

The <percentage> CSS data type represents a
percentage value. It is often used to define a
size as relative to an element's parent
object. Numerous properties can use
percentages, such as width, height , margin
padding, and font-size

A fixed-width layout allows the designer to
build pages that will look identical no matter
who is looking at them. Fixed-width elements
such as images will not overpower text on
smaller monitors because the width of the
entire page will include those elements.
